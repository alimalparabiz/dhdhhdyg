              That foundation gave me the confidence to dream bigger.</p>

              downloaded
              and rated highly. It taught me that shipping products is about delivering joy and real impact, not just
              code.

              across AWS, DigitalOcean, and Vapor, and turned a struggling department into a profitable one. I also led
              incident responses that restored critical business operations. These experiences taught me that nothing is

          <h2 class="section-title" id="about-title">About Me</h2>
          <p>I have always been driven by one thing: <strong>solving problems</strong>. For years, I had more ideas than
            I
            could ever build, and the time it took to go from vision to execution held me back. That changed the moment
            I
            began working with modern AI. It did not feel like another tool, it felt like a <strong>superpower</strong>
            that
            allowed me to bring ideas to life at a speed I had only imagined.</p>
          <p>That shift let me move across domains with confidence. From <strong>DevOps and security</strong> to
            <strong>full-stack and mobile development</strong>, I have learned to connect the dots and deliver
            <strong>AI
              products that are practical, scalable, and production-ready</strong>. I do not separate skills into silos,
            I
            use them together to build systems that solve real business problems.
          </p>
          <p>What excites me most today is the craft of <strong>prompt and context engineering</strong>. For me, it is
            not
            just about improving responses, it is about designing systems that are reliable, explainable, and ready for
            the
            real world. I keep learning, experimenting, and staying curious about what comes next. <strong>What a time
              to be
              alive.</strong></p>
