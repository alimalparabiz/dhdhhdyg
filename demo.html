        <p>I didn’t start my career in AI. For years I was a full‑stack and mobile developer, shipping everything from sleek web dashboards to a native educational app that now has thousands of installs and a 4.68‑star rating. I loved turning ideas into polished products, but I kept wondering: what if software could go beyond executing commands? What if it could understand, anticipate and collaborate with us?</p>
        <p>That question led me down the rabbit hole of large language models. My first experiments were practical: I built a <strong>Sales Enablement GPT</strong> to give an overworked sales team instant access to scattered data and automated proposal generation. Next came a <strong>multi‑platform ad and image generator</strong> that slashed campaign creation time by 98%. Along the way I prototyped meeting assistants that transcribe and assign tasks, SEO content generators that produce ready‑to‑publish articles, and even a community‑support GPT that answered millions of questions during a major pilgrimage.</p>
        <h2>Bridging Disciplines</h2>
        <p>Those successes didn’t happen in a vacuum. Before diving into generative AI I spent years in DevOps, FinOps and security—automating infrastructure audits, fixing chaotic billing systems and responding to real‑world breaches. That experience taught me how to build reliable systems, control costs and protect user data. It’s a perspective I bring to every AI project: models are only as valuable as the infrastructure and business processes they’re embedded in.</p>
        <p>Today I focus on designing prompt architectures and conversational workflows that unlock LLMs’ potential. I still draw on my “quarter‑rounder” past—equal parts developer, product manager, operations lead and technologist—to build solutions that are technically sound, user‑centric and business‑ready. The generative revolution is just beginning, and I’m excited to keep exploring how these models can augment human creativity and productivity.</p>
