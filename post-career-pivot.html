            <div class="post__content">
                <p>I began in software engineering. I wrote Java, shipped web dashboards, and built a native Android app
                    that earned thousands of installs with a strong rating. I loved turning ideas into real products.
                    Over time I wanted software that could understand intent and collaborate with users. That led me to
                    generative AI.</p>

                <h2>First experiments</h2>
                <p>I started small. I built a Sales Enablement GPT that pulled answers from scattered content. I built a
                    multi platform ad generator that wrote copy and image prompts. I then built meeting assistants, SEO
                    generators, and community tools. Each project taught me that prompts and workflow design are the
                    invisible layer that make AI useful.</p>

                <h2>What transferred from my past roles</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Systems thinking.</strong> DevOps and security work taught me to build for reliability
                        and risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Product sense.</strong> Full stack work taught me to ship fast without breaking quality.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Measurement.</strong> Operations work taught me to track results and iterate.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why prompt engineering</h2>
                <p>Prompt engineering is where language, logic, and product thinking meet. It turns models from
                    interesting to useful. It is not magic. It is structure, clarity, and testing.</p>

                <h2>Advice for others</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pick a small problem and build a focused assistant for it.</li>
                    <li>Add constraints and examples to your prompts.</li>
                    <li>Test with real inputs and keep a simple log of changes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Closing</h2>
                <p>I moved into prompt engineering because it lets me ship value faster. I am excited to keep learning
                    and to build systems that help people do their best work.</p>
